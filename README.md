# Checkvist Estimator Chrome Extension

This work in progress chrome extension will ultimately enable the use of Checkvist.com to create project estimates.

Currently, I use tags to record how long a particular item in a checkvist outline will take (e.g. #hrs-8). The goal of this extension is to tag parent items with the total hours of its children. This is something I'm currently doing manually.
