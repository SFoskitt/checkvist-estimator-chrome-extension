# Checkvist Estimator Chrome Extension

This chrome extension enables the use of [Checkvist.com](http://checkvist.com) to create project estimates.

Currently, I use tags to record how many hours a particular item in a checkvist outline will take (e.g. #hrs-8). This extension will tag parent items with the total hours of its children. 

The extension currently only uses tags with the #hrs- prefix.

## TO DO: 
- allow for customizable tag prefix or suffix for hours
- allow for option to use days with customizable tag prefix or suffix
- allow for choice of created tags in hours, days or both
