# Checkvist Estimator Chrome Extension

This chrome extension enables the use of [Checkvist.com](http://checkvist.com) to create project estimates.

Currently, I use tags to record how many hours or days a particular item in a checkvist outline will take (e.g. #8h or #2d). This extension will tag parent items with the totals of its children. 

The extension options allow you to define your hours and/or days tag format and choose to use them as a prefix or suffix as well as define hour many working hours should equal 1 day. You may also choose for the extension to generate hours tags, days tags or both.

To try it out, download the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mifdcejomojmjllmcgjoopnafpgaloko?hl=en-US&gl=US) or clone the source and [install in Chrome's Developer Mode](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/getstarted.html).
